# HudlU-ES-Cert
Files from my Hudl-University Elasticsearch Capstone project. For an overview of what I did for my project and my results, view the file [Overview.pdf](https://github.com/valbooth28/HudlU-ES-Cert/blob/master/Overview.pdf).

**About the Course:**
This is the capstone for the internal *@Hudl* certification for [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/). The certification was a four week class of 1 hour segments each, taught by resident Hudlie ES experts *@andypryor*, *@rlhotovy*, and *@agilejon*. The capstone assignment was to build an index using concepts from all 4 segments, which covered such topics as Basic and Advanced Querying and Operations at Hudl using ES.
