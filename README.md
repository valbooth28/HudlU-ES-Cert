# HudlU-ES-Cert
Files from my Hudl-University Elasticsearch Capstone project. For an overview of what I did for my project and my results, please see Overview.pdf.

_About the Course:_
This is the capstone for the internal @Hudl certification for Elasticseach (https://www.elastic.co/). The certification was a four week class of 1 hour segments each, taught by resident Hudlie ES experts @andypryor, @rlhotovy, and @agilejon. The capstone assignment was to build an index using concepts from all 4 segments, which covered such topics as Basic and Advanced Querying and Operations at Hudl using ES.
